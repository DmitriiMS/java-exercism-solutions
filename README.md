# java-exercism-solutions
Solutions for [exercism.org Java track](https://exercism.org/tracks/java).
This repository only tracks files that dre downloaded with exercism-cli excluding .exercism folder.
Anything else that is downloaded and generated by the IDE is ignored.
.gitignore needs refactoring, i'll get to that later.
